# Vulnerability Assessment – Web Application Lab

## Project Description

This repository contains a vulnerability assessment performed in a personal lab environment.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate practical skills in vulnerability analysis, web application security testing, and technical reporting. The assessment was conducted following a structured approach similar to what is used in real-world cybersecurity engagements.
